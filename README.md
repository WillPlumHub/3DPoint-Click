# 3DPoint-Click

In this demo you can click on specific objects to move the camera over to them. The idea is that you can then use the mouse to interact with objects in each area as move back a
step to the center of the room by right clicking, however these havn't been implemented yet. YET. As I say in the most recent commit, this project was started in summer 2019,
and wasn't initially finished due to post secondary and eventually COVID 19 redirecting my attention away from the project. I do intend on finishing it once I'm able to focus all
of my energy on it, but I can't say when that will be yet. Still I hope you enjoy my little demo.
